<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Veer, and I’m 13 years old. I was born on February 14th, 2011, so yes, that makes me a Valentine’s Day kid! I’m really into football — it’s my favorite sport. I play it all the time with my friends or even just by myself if I’m feeling like practicing. I also love math; it’s probably my strongest subject at school. Numbers just make sense to me, and solving problems feels really rewarding. But, I can’t say I’m a fan of science. It just doesn’t interest me the same way. I struggle to keep up with all the experiments and theories.</p>
<p>When I’m not in school, I like to relax by playing video games. My top three are FIFA, Roblox, and Minecraft. I’m always trying to beat my high scores or build cool stuff in Minecraft. FIFA is amazing because I get to play as my favorite football players and teams. Roblox is fun because there are so many different games I can play with my friends, and Minecraft lets me be creative and build anything I want.
<p>I also like watching Netflix when I have free time. There are a lot of cool shows and movies I watch, but I have to admit, I spend more time gaming than watching TV. As for school, I do okay — not straight A’s, but I manage to keep up with everything.
<p>I’m still figuring out what I want to do when I grow up. Some days I think about being a football player, but other days I think about doing something with math or computers. Who knows? I’ve got plenty of time to figure it out!
