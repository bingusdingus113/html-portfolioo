<h3> Marvels Avengers Infinity war</h3>
<p>well made, perfect amount of suspense and thriller and one of the few movies in which the villain wins (even though he lost at the next movie)</p>
<h3> Marvels Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 3</h3>
<p>A funny movie and I think its really good to watch with family and friends</p>
<h3> Marvels Spider Man Far From Home</h3>
<p> The plot is so nice and again its well made with the cgi</p>
